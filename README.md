## Explanation of `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt`

- **gitignore**: The git ignore file tells Git which files and directories to ignore in your repository. This is useful for excluding temporary files, build artifacts, and sensitive data.

- **requirements.txt**:The requirements.txt file is used to list Python dependencies for a project. It allows others to install the same dependencies using pip.
